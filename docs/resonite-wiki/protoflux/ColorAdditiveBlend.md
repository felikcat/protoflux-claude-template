Colors

Color Additive Blend does an additive blend of its two input colors. The result is the sum of each component between the target and destination.

This is a symmetric operation, the result is the same with target and destination swapped. Regardless, the "target" and "destination" terminology is used for consistency with other blend nodes.

Alpha values are clamped to a maximum of 1.
