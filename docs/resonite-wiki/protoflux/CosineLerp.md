Lerp

Interpolation

The **Cosine Lerp** node takes in a starting low point `A` (the minimum part of the curve) and a high point `B` (the maximum part of the curve) along with a lerp value of which it lerps similarly like a [cosine](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Cos "ProtoFlux:Cos") wave and returning back to the low point, then returns the value over time.

This is clamped, meaning that you are stuck with being in between the `A` and `B` values.

## Inputs

### A (Pseudo-Generic)

The starting (low) point of this lerp curve.

### B (Pseudo-Generic)

The high point of this lerp curve.

### Lerp ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

The lerp value for this curve.

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-Generic)

Returns the value currently being lerped.
