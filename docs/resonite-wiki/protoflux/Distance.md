Distance

A

\*

B

Operators

The **Distance** node returns the [Euclidean distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance) between two vectors. This is similar to using [Sub](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Sub "ProtoFlux:Sub") and [Value Abs](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Value_Abs "ProtoFlux:Value Abs"), just in one node.

## Inputs

### A (Pseudo-Generic)

The first vector.

### B (Pseudo-Generic)

The second vector.

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-Generic)

The Euclidean distance between `A` and `B`.
