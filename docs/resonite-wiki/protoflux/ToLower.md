Characters

The **ToLower** node takes in a character or string and outputs it as lowercase. This node takes into account the local user's [CultureInfo](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:CultureInfo "Type:CultureInfo").

## Inputs

### \\* (Generic)

The character or string to make lowercase.

## Outputs

### \\* (Generic)

The lowercase version of the given character or string. Characters that do not have a lowercase version mapped will not be changed.

The specifics of Unicode uppercase and lowercase character mapping is too involved for this wiki page, but if one is interested, see [the official Unicode data file](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt) as well as [the format used for the file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property#Semantic_elements).
