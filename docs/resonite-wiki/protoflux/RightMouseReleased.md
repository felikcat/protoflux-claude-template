Right Mouse Released

\*

Mouse

The `Right Mouse Released` node returns the local [user's](https://wiki.resonite.com/User "User") right mouse button being released. This will change within that frame, so combining it with [Fire On True](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Fire_On_True "ProtoFlux:Fire On True") is recommended.

## Outputs

### \\* ( [bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool"))

The result from the user's right mouse button that just released.
