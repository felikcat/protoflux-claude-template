Parsing

The `Parse Value` node takes in a string and attempts to parse out the information into a value that can be used by other nodes. The value can be anything as long as it is a [Value Type](https://wiki.resonite.com/Value_Type "Value Type"), and can also give you whether it had parsed it or not.

If you are looking for a node to make something into a string instead, try [To String](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:To_String "ProtoFlux:To String").
