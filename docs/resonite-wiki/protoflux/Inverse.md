M-1(inverse)

A

\*

Matrix

The **Inverse** node takes in a matrix, then returns the inverted matrix. Since there is no matrix division, this node is a solution for getting something similar to that situation when needed (under the hood, it just multiplies to get the same result as division). This is also used to reverse a translation of a matrix.

Beware, as not all matrices can be calculated using this node, specifically if the [Determinant](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Determinant "ProtoFlux:Determinant") is showing `0`, then it is as if you were dividing by 0, making an undefined result.
