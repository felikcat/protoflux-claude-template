Determinant

A

\*

Matrix

The **Determinant** node takes in a matrix value and returns the area of the matrix.

It is worth noting that this only works with a square matrix (a matrix with the same number of rows and columns). As of currently, you can only create a matrix that is square in [Resonite](https://wiki.resonite.com/Resonite "Resonite"), this is not an issue until an update that allows for different sized matrices.


Applications used by this:

- Transformations and Graphics
- Collision Detection
- Physics Simulations
- Camera Systems
- Optimization and Efficiency

## Inputs

### A (Pseudo-Generic)

The matrix value.

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-Generic)

Returns the determinant of that matrix.
