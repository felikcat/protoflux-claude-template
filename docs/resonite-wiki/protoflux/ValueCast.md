[![A picture of a value cast. Looks like a square object with one side a different color than the other, with a split down the middle that has a beveled edge. Though it's just an image so you can't actually feel such bevel in game even with detailed haptics.](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/9/95/ProtoFlux_visuals_Value_Cast.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:ProtoFlux_visuals_Value_Cast.png)

The **Value Cast** node exists in two forms. In the **Casts** category, it casts any [Value](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Value "Type:Value") or [Nullable](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Nullable%601 "Type:Nullable`1") into an [Object](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Object "Type:Object"). In the **Core/Casts** category, it exists as a menu for all valid casts between any two respective values, such as casting a [float4](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float4 "Type:Float4") into a [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3").

## Inputs

### Input (Pseudo-generic)

The [Value](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Value "Type:Value") or [Nullable](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Nullable%601 "Type:Nullable`1") to cast.

### \\* (Pseudo-generic)
