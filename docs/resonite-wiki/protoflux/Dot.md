Vectors

The **Dot** node (also called **Dot Product**) takes in 2 vector values and returns a product as a [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"). This result comes from the projection from one vector onto another, and is commutative (order of inputs do not matter).

If vectors have similar directions, the result is positive. if the vectors are perpendicular, the result is `0`. If the vectors are going in opposite directions, the result will be negative.

This product is a scaler, which returns a number. If you want something that returns a vector, use the [Cross](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Cross "ProtoFlux:Cross") node instead.


## Inputs

### A (Pseudo-Generic)

The first vector value.

### B (Pseudo-Generic)

The seconds vector value.

## Outputs

### \\* ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

Returns the dot product of these 2 vectors.
