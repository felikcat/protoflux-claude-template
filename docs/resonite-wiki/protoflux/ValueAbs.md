Abs

N

\*

Math

The **Value Abs** node takes in a value and returns a value without its sign. Although, it would be truly impossible to have no sign on a value when it needs to be represented and stored in a computer device (and also mathematically sound), so it returns as a positive number (no matter what is provided as a value).

You can think of using this node as "the distance from 0".

If you just need a value to be the opposite sign, use the [Value Negate](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Value_Negate "ProtoFlux:Value Negate") node instead.
