String To Absolute URI

Input

\*

Network

The `String To Absolute URI` node takes in a string literal and converts it into a [Uri](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Uri "Type:Uri") type string output. This Uri is intended to be used in network applications (or anywhere a Uri could be used, such as file operations), similar to using a URL for websites.

This is incredibly useful for gathering assets using links from this node. Some uses could be to get a URL link to play a video on a [Video Player](https://wiki.resonite.com/Video_Player "Video Player"), getting images from a server, or getting resdb links or ".brson" files.

## Inputs

### Input ( [string](https://wiki.resonite.com/String "String"))

The string to convert into a Uri.

## Outputs

### \\* ( [Uri](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Uri "Type:Uri"))

The Uri output to be used in network applications.
