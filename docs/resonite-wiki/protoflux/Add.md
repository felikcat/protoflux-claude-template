The **Add** node takes in 2 inputs and returns the calculated result. The second input (`B`) will add to the first input (`A`).

This node is special as it also works with the [String](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:String "Type:String") type, adding (concatenating) them together.

If you just need to add + 1 to your value, use the [Value Inc](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Value_Inc "ProtoFlux:Value Inc") node instead.

If you need to increment a value from an [impulse](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses"), use the [Increment](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Increment "ProtoFlux:Increment") node instead.

## Inputs
