Char To String

Input

Characters

The **Char to String** node acts as a cast to turn a [character](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Char "Type:Char") into a [string](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:String "Type:String").

This is very useful when working with individual characters and one needs to use string operations, such as concatenation, with said characters.

## Inputs

### Input ( [char](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Char "Type:Char"))

The character to turn into a string.

## Outputs

### \\* ( [string](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:String "Type:String"))

The resulting converted string.

## Examples

All 3 strings are plugged in to a Concatenate Multi String, where hte output is "7 Drunken Sailors"](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/9/95/Protoflux_example_Char_To_String.webp/480px-Protoflux_example_Char_To_String.webp.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:Protoflux_example_Char_To_String.webp "Example of using Char To String in some ProtoFlux code, wherein the characters \"7\" and a space are cast to string, then combined in a Concatenate Multi String to form a phrase.")

Example of using Char To String in some ProtoFlux code, wherein the characters "7" and a space are cast to string, then combined in a [Concatenate Multi String](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Concatenate_Multi_String "ProtoFlux:Concatenate Multi String") to form a phrase.
