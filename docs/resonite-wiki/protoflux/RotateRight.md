Rotate

Boolean

The **Rotate Right** node takes in a value we want to rotate (using a bitwise operation, called a [circular shift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_shift)) and the amount we want to rotate by to the right, and returns the new rotated value. Rotating is the act of moving the bits in a byte in a direction, and when rotating, the bits that fall outside the bounds will cycle around to the other side of the byte.

## Inputs

### A (Pseudo-Generic)

The value we want to rotate.

### Rotate ( [int](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Int "Type:Int"))

The amount to rotate this value by to the right.

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-Generic)

The new rotated value.
