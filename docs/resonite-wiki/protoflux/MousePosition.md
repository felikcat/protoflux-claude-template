Mouse Position
*
Mouse
The `Mouse Position` node returns the local [user's](https://wiki.resonite.com/User "User") mouse position from their [Resonite](https://wiki.resonite.com/Resonite "Resonite") application in pixels. The mouse position calculation starts at the top-left of the Resonite window. If you are focused on the Resonite window, the mouse will usually be centered in that window while you move the mouse around (unless interacting with a UI or in freecam mode), giving an almost constant output from this node (in this case, x axis divided by 2 and y axis divided by 2). When the Resonite application is not focused, the cursor won't be tracked at all and will snap to the bottom left (returning "[0; max Y]" of your Resonite window size). Having multiple monitors will not affect this node. 
## Outputs
### * ([float2](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float2 "Type:Float2"))
The position of the mouse on the Resonite application currently.
