Ping Pong

N

\*

Length

Math

The **Ping Pong** node takes in a number and the length, then returns a value that fits in that range, only bouncing back to the start when the number would be too large compared to the length, repeatedly.

## Inputs

### N (Pseudo-Generic)

The number provided for this ping pong.

### Length (Pseudo-Generic)

The range/limit for this ping pong calculation.

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-Generic)

The calculated value currently. If a number surpasses this, it bounces back. The same is true for the other side, bouncing forwards again. This repeats for as many times equal to the size of the provided number.
