_due to wiki limitations, this node does not currently have an HTML rendering of the node._

Filter Input is a ProtoFlux node that is usually generated by first equipping a [ProtoFlux Tool](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux_Tool "ProtoFlux Tool"), dragging a wire from output of any type except [Impulses](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses") on a ProtoFlux node, and then hitting secondary.

## Inputs

### Input (Generic)

Any value data type

Outputs to the node's visual UI without an actual value. It displays the value as a string and in the case of non primitives displays some information.
