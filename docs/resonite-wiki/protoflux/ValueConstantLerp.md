Constant Lerp

Input

\*

Speed

Interpolation

The **Constant Lerp** node takes in an input value and the speed at which it lerps it linearly towards, then returns the lerped value over time.

If you need the lerp to have a smooth ending, use the [Value Smooth Lerp](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Value_Smooth_Lerp "ProtoFlux:Value Smooth Lerp") node instead.


## Inputs

### Input (Pseudo-Generic)

The value we want to lerp towards.

### Speed ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

How fast the lerp should be. The output value will change by this amount per second.

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-Generic)

Returns the value currently being lerped.
