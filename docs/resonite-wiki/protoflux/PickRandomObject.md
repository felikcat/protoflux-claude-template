Utility

The `Pick Random Object` node takes in a list of [references](https://wiki.resonite.com/Reference_Type "Reference Type") of the same [Type](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Type "Type:Type") and then returns one of them at random. Since this is a data node, displaying the output value will cycle through them randomly once per frame.

## Inputs

### Operands (Generic)

The list of references to randomly pick from.

## Outputs

### \\* (Generic)

The randomly picked reference.
