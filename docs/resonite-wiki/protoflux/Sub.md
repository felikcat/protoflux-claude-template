Operators

The **Sub** node takes in 2 inputs and returns the calculated result. The second input (`B`) will take away anything from the first input (`A`).

Keep in mind that the subtraction operation is antisymmetric (where you put your inputs matter), and is [Anticommutative](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anticommutative_property) (which basically means if you swap the inputs but made the result have the opposite sign, you can get the same answer).

If you just need to subtract 1 from your value, use the [Value Dec](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Value_Dec "ProtoFlux:Value Dec") node instead.

If you need to decrement a value from an [impulse](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses"), use the [Decrement](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Decrement "ProtoFlux:Decrement") node instead.

## Inputs

### A (Pseudo-Generic)

The value we have.

### B (Pseudo-Generic)

The value we want to take away.

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-Generic)

The new result from this operation.
