Constants

The **Tau** node outputs the mathematical constant [tau](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_(mathematical_constant)). Tau is a constant that represents 2 [PI](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Pi "ProtoFlux:Pi"). Tau is the circumference of a circle with a radius of one.

Applications this constant can be used in:

- Circumference, angular, and rotation measurements
- Wave Generation (combined with [Sin](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Sin "ProtoFlux:Sin"))
- Shader Programming (usually simplifying/streamlining the code)

## Outputs

### \\* ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

Returns the value constant Tau. Its [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float") value is approximately `6.28318`.
