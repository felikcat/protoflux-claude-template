Utility

The `Pick Random Value` node takes in a list of [value](https://wiki.resonite.com/Value_Type "Value Type") of the same [Type](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Type "Type:Type") and then returns one of them at random. Since this is a data node, displaying the output value will cycle through them randomly once per frame.
