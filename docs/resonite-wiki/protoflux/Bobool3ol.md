Bobool3ol

Constants

This page represents a meme/joke, and contains jokes from the community or the [Team](https://wiki.resonite.com/Team "Team").


**Bobool3ol** is a constant node of type bobool3ol. Its display node contains the text "Tru(🍒🎂🍒)lse".

This node is the result of a typo which he decided to keep in the game.[\[1\]](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Bobool3ol#cite_note-1) Unlike other joke constants like the [OwO](https://wiki.resonite.com/OwO_(ProtoFlux) "OwO (ProtoFlux)") node, the bobool3ol node actually corresponds to an internal bobool3ol class. This class can be compared, but is not a variable and cannot be written to.

Doing boolean logic with bobool3ol is also unpredictable. Checking if a bobool3ol is equal to another bobool3ol returns "true", however checking if that true is equal to a "regular" true returns false. While interesting, it is ultimately useless as bobool3ol cannot be altered or written to, meaning its behavior is constant and not useful.
