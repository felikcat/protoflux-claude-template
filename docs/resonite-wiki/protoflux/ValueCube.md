Operators

The **Value Cube** node takes in a value and cubes it, basically returning itself multiplied by itself 3 times.

This is similar to using the [Pow](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Pow "ProtoFlux:Pow") node, and using the value that you want to cube and setting the power to 3.

If you want to square a value, use the [Value Square](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Value_Square "ProtoFlux:Value Square") node instead.
