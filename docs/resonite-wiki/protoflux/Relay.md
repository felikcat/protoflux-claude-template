# ProtoFlux:Relay

> Source: https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Relay

[Relay](https://wiki.resonite.com/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=Relay.png "File:Relay.png") A [ProtoFlux](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux "ProtoFlux") Relay.

The **Relay** node can be for data or [impulses](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses"). Relays are commonly used to route wires for an easier time reading [ProtoFlux](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux "ProtoFlux").

The impulse relays are used to rearrange and combine impulse wires together for managing Protoflux code. Impulse relays can take many inputs connections and can only have one output connection.

The data relays takes in an input and outputs the same type, carrying the same [value](https://wiki.resonite.com/Value_type "Value type") or [reference](https://wiki.resonite.com/Reference_type "Reference type") from the input. Data relays can only take one input connection and can have many output connections.

Be careful when using a lot of relays for your ProtoFlux, as data relays incur a small performance loss for each one added. The same is not true for impulse relays.


## Inputs

### \\* (Generic)

A value, reference, or impulse to carry across for the output.

## Outputs

### Input (Generic)

A value, reference, or impulse from the input.
