On Paste

Trigger

Events

On Paste is a ProtoFlux node that sends an impulse out of Trigger whenever the node is part of a hierarchy that has been spawned via clip board pasting. This is useful for telling if an item has been spawned in via [RedX](https://wiki.resonite.com/RedX "RedX") or cloud spawned, or spawned in via a json file.

TODO: Does this node fire when the entire node group this is connected to is loaded after paste? or all of them? or just this one node?

## Outputs

### Trigger ( [Call](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses"))

Sends an Impulse when the node is spawned in with an object that has been spawned via pasting from clipboard.
