Operators

The **Approximately** node takes in two values that could potentially be close enough within a certain `Epsilon` range. If the values are considered close enough, this node will return true.

![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/c/c1/SuggestionIcon.svg)

If you need to check something that is not within the approximate range between the 2 values, use the [Approximately Not](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Approximately_Not "ProtoFlux:Approximately Not") node.


## Inputs

### A (Pseudo-Generic)

The first value to check.

### B (Pseudo-Generic)

The second value to check.

### Epsilon (Pseudo-Generic)

The smallest distance to check when comparing the 2 values. (Default: `9.403955E-38`)

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-Generic)

If the values are close enough to each other, return true.
