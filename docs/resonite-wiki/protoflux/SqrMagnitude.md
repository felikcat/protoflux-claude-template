Vectors

The **SqrMagnitude** node takes in a vector value and returns the length of that vector, multiplied by itself. This is similar to taking the [Magnitude](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Magnitude "ProtoFlux:Magnitude") and the [Mul](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Mul "ProtoFlux:Mul") nodes to get the same result.

## Inputs

### A (Pseudo-Generic)

The vector to check.

## Outputs

### \\* ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

Returns the length of that vector squared.
