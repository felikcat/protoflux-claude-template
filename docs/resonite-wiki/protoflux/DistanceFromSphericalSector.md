Geometry 3D

The **Distance From Spherical Sector** node takes a point in 3D space and computes the distance from a spherical sector defined by its center, direction, radius, and angle. Then it returns the distance from that sphere.

## Inputs

### Center ( [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3"))

The center of the sphere.

### Direction ( [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3"))

The facing direction of the sphere.

### Radius ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

The radius of the sphere.

### Angle ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

The angle this point and sphere is going to be using for calculations.

### Point ( [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3"))

The point we are checking.

## Outputs

### \\* ( [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3"))

Returns the distance from the point and the sphere compared with the point given.
