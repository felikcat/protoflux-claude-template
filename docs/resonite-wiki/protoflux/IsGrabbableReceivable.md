Grabbable

Is Grabbable Grabbed is a ProtoFlux node that gets whether or not an [IGrabbable](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:IGrabbable "Type:IGrabbable") is able to be received. This only really applies to the [Grabbable component](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:Grabbable "Component:Grabbable") since it is the only [IGrabbable](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:IGrabbable "Type:IGrabbable") that can return a true value.

Receivable determines if a grabbable can be dropped onto a [GrabbableReceiverSurface](https://wiki.resonite.com/GrabbableReceiverSurface_(Component) "GrabbableReceiverSurface (Component)") when let go of. The receivable has to be close enough for the receiver to receive it.

## Inputs

### Grabbable ( [IGrabbable](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:IGrabbable "Type:IGrabbable"))

The grabbable to check the receivable capabilities for.

## Outputs

### \\* ( [bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool"))

Whether Grabbable ( [IGrabbable](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:IGrabbable "Type:IGrabbable")) is receivable or not.
