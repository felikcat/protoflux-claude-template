Bounds

The **Empty** node outputs an empty bounding box.

## Outputs

### \\* ( [BoundingBox](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:BoundingBox "Type:BoundingBox"))

An empty bounding box.

## Issues

- Currently the empty bounding box is returning really large numbers in opposite directions, and is currently being investigated by [Frooxius](https://wiki.resonite.com/User:Frooxius "User:Frooxius") in this GitHub issue: [#2090](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/2090)
