Operators

The **Value Reciprocal** node takes in a value and that will be used to determine the result (or quotient) of a division, where 1 is the dividend, and the value we provide is the divisor.

This acts similarly to the [Div](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Div "ProtoFlux:Div") node, but 1 is being provided for us as the value we want to split across our divisor.


## Inputs

### N (Pseudo-Generic)

The value that will be the divisor of the division.

## Outputs

The result (or quotient) of the division.
