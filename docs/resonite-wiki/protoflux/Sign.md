The **Sign** node takes in a number and returns a `-1`, `0`, or `1` depending on the sign of the number.

## Inputs

### N (Pseudo-generic)

The number to check the sign of.

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-generic)

Returns the sign of `N` of the same type represented as a 1 (positive), a -1 (negative), or a zero (0). If `N` is `Infinity` or `-Infinity`, a `1` or `-1` is returned, respectively. If `N` is `NaN`, `0` is returned. If `N` is a type with multiple fields, each field is signed individually.
