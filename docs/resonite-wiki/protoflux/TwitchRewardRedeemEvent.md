Twitch

This node provides Twitch reward redeem information from a [TwitchInterface](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:TwitchInterface "Component:TwitchInterface").

Note that all outputs are generated on a new Twitch reward redeem, and will not display any information when connected to a display node.

## Legacy Twitch API

Due to the depreciation of the Twitch V5 API that Resonite currently uses, this node will fail to pulse on a redeem event from Twitch. This means currently that this node is inoperable, and should be considered unusable until updated.

The issue is marked as a bug on the Resonite GitHub under [Issue 68](https://github.com/Yellow-Dog-Man/Resonite-Issues/issues/68).
