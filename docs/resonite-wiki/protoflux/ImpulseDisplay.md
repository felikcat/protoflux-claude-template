The **Impulse Display** node displays incoming [impulses](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses") to the node. The node will display:

- The [User](https://wiki.resonite.com/User "User") that owns the impulse, with lines on the display being a different color per user
- The [world time](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:World_Time_Float "ProtoFlux:World Time Float") at the time of the impulse
- The _index_ of the impulse.

  - Indices are only tracked through pulse displays. This can be useful for determining which code path executes before another.

An impulse display can be easily created with the [ProtoFlux Tool](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux_Tool "ProtoFlux Tool") by dragging out an impulse output and pressing [secondary](https://wiki.resonite.com/Basic_Controls "Basic Controls").
