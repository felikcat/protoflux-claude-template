Physics

The **Trajectory Position** node takes an initial velocity, force of gravity, drag, and time period, and then outputs the change in position of an object that it would experience. This is very useful for simulating movement.

## Inputs

### Initial Velocity ( [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3"))

The initial velocity (speed and direction).

### Gravity ( [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3"))

The direction and strength of gravity.

### Drag ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

The resistance in movement.

### Time ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

The change in time between initial and final position.

## Outputs

### \\* ( [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3"))

The change in position that would have happened in the time frame.

## Examples

No examples have been given at this time. Examples of potential uses include:

- Instantly calculating the end position of a projectile
- Simulating the movement of a ball
