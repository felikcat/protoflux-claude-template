Constant Slerp

Input

\*

Speed

Interpolation

The **Constant Slerp** node takes in an input value and the speed of which it slerps linearly towards, then returns the value over time.

The "S" part of the slerp stands for "spherical", which means that it deals more with rotations and the values relating to that type of movement ( [floatQ](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:FloatQ "Type:FloatQ") for reference).

If you need the slerp to be smooth, use the [Smooth Slerp](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Smooth_Slerp "ProtoFlux:Smooth Slerp") node instead.


## Inputs

### Input (Pseudo-Generic)

The value we want to slerp towards.

### Speed ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

How fast the slerp should be.

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-Generic)

Returns the value currently being slerped.
