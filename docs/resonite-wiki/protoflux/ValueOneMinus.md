Operators

The **Value One Minus** node takes in a value and subtracts it from a starting point of 1. This can be done similarly with the [Sub](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Sub "ProtoFlux:Sub") node.

This node is useful for working with [Blendshapes](https://wiki.resonite.com/index.php?title=Blendshape&action=edit&redlink=1 "Blendshape (page does not exist)"), especially when you want one blendshape to be the opposite value of the other.
