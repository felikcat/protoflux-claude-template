Slerp

From

\*

To

Lerp

Interpolation

The **Slerp** node takes in a starting point and an ending point along with a lerp value that represents its point in between those. Then it returns the lerped value over time.

The "S" part of the slerp stands for "spherical", which means that it deals more with rotations and the values relating to that type of movement ( [floatQ](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:FloatQ "Type:FloatQ") for reference).

## Inputs

### From (Pseudo-Generic)

The starting point of this lerp.

### To (Pseudo-Generic)

The ending point of this lerp.

### Lerp ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

The lerp value between the start and end points.

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-Generic)

Returns the value currently being lerped.
