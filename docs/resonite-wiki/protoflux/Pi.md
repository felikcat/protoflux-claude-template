π

Constants

The **Pi** node outputs the mathematical constant [π](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi).

Applications this can be used in:

- Geometry and Circle Calculations
- Rotations and Angle Calculations
- Wave Generation (combined with [Sin](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Sin "ProtoFlux:Sin"))
- Physics Simulations (especially when dealing with circular motion, pendulum movements, or orbital mechanics)
- Procedural Generation (especially curves)
- Lighting and Shading (used in lighting models to calculate angles and intensities of light, reflections, and refractions)
- Animation Curves

If you need to use 2PI for calculations, instead of using the [Mul](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Mul "ProtoFlux:Mul") or [Add](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Add "ProtoFlux:Add") nodes, you can use the [Tau](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Tau "ProtoFlux:Tau") node to do the same thing, streamlining your ProtoFlux.


## Outputs

### \\* ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

The value of π, approximately `3.14159274`.
