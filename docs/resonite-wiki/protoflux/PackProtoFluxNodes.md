Nodes

The `Pack ProtoFlux Nodes` node takes in the [Slot](https://wiki.resonite.com/Slot "Slot") root (where we want to pack to), and the Slot target (the set of [ProtoFlux](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux "ProtoFlux") nodes we want to pack), then packs them into the Slot. Many [community-based tools](https://wiki.resonite.com/Community_Tools "Community Tools") (such as [Redprint](https://wiki.resonite.com/Redprint "Redprint")) use this to pack nodes into slots.
