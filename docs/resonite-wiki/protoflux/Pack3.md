Packing

The **Pack 3** node takes in 3 values and combines them into a new value of a similar type, returning a variant that has the combined separated values. (Example: `int` \+ `int` \+ `int` = `int3`)

This can also Pack or combine float3, which is its most common use in ProtoFlux.

### Y (Pseudo-Generic)

### Z (Pseudo-Generic)
