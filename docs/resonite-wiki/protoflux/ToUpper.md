Characters

The **ToUpper** node takes in a character or string and outputs it as uppercase. This node takes into account the local user's [CultureInfo](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:CultureInfo "Type:CultureInfo").

## Inputs

### \\* (Generic)

The character or string to make uppercase.

## Outputs

### \\* (Generic)

The uppercase variant of the given character or string. Characters that do not have an uppercase version mapped will not be changed.

The specifics of Unicode uppercase and lowercase character mapping is too involved for this wiki page, but if one is interested, see [the official Unicode data file](https://www.unicode.org/Public/UCD/latest/ucd/UnicodeData.txt) as well as [the format used for the file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_character_property#Semantic_elements).
