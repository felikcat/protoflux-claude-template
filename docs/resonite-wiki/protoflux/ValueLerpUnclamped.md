Lerp (Unclamped)

From

\*

To

Lerp

Interpolation

The **Value Lerp Unclamped** node takes in a starting point and an ending point along with a lerp value of which it lerps linearly towards, then returns the value over time.

This is unclamped, meaning that you are not stuck with being in between the `From` and `To` values, which can exceed past those.

If you need the lerp to be in between the start and end values, use the [Value Lerp](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Value_Lerp "ProtoFlux:Value Lerp") node instead.


## Inputs

### From (Pseudo-Generic)

The starting point of this lerp.

### To (Pseudo-Generic)

The ending point of this lerp.

### Lerp ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

The lerp value between the start and end points.

## Outputs

### \\* (Pseudo-Generic)

Returns the value currently being lerped.
