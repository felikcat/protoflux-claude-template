[A visual image of an Continuation Relay node by itself, connected to nothing.](https://wiki.resonite.com/index.php?title=Special:Upload&wpDestFile=ProtoFlux_visuals_Continuation_Relay.webp "File:ProtoFlux visuals Continuation Relay.webp")

_due to wiki limitations, this node does not currently have an HTML rendering of the node._

A Continuation Relay is made by having a ProtoFlux tool equipped, and grabbing onto a ProtoFlux [continuation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses") wire with grip with the tool in hand. It will splice the wire and place the node in the middle, acting as a rerouter. It has no behavior, and simply acts as a visual arrangement tool.
