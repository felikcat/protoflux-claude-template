Logₑ

Math
The `Log` node takes in a number we are trying to get to and already provides us the base as [e](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:E "ProtoFlux:E"), which represents approximately 2.71828. This is called the natural logarithm (often written as `ln`), and returns the result of how many times of base e to get that number that was provided. 
![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/d/dd/InformationIcon.svg)
Usually written as `ln⁡(x)`
This natural logarithm asks a question: What power must e be raised to, in order to get x?. 
  

## Inputs
### N (Pseudo-generic)
The number we are searching for using the base ([e](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:E "ProtoFlux:E")). 
## Outputs
### * (Pseudo-generic)
Returns the exponent result. 
## Examples
### Example: Using e
```
   Start with the equation:
   ln⁡(e³) = ?

```
```
   Understand the question:
   We're asking: "What power must e be raised to, in order to get e³?"

```
```
   Since e is already raised to the power of 3, the answer is simply 3. So:
   ln⁡(e³) = 3

```

### Example: ln⁡(7.389)
```
   Start with the equation:
   ln⁡(7.389) = ?

```
```
   Use the definition:
   We need to find the power to which e must be raised to get approximately 7.389.

```
```
   Using a calculator:
   When you calculate ln⁡(7.389), you get:
   ln⁡(7.389) ≈ 2

```
```
   This means:
   e² ≈ 7.389

```
