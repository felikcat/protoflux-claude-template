Reference ID

Element

\*

References

The `Reference ID` node takes in an element, which could be anything since it is an [IWorldElement](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:IWorldElement "Type:IWorldElement"), then returns a [RefID](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:RefID "Type:RefID") of that world element. Since the RefID type is used internally in the engine, it is unlikely to see any use besides read references.

This node can also be used in [Ref Hacking](https://wiki.resonite.com/Ref_Hacking "Ref Hacking"), and the content you use with this node for that reason may break at anytime!
