Characters

The **Concatenate Chars** node combines two characters into a new string.

This is very useful when working with individual characters and need to perform string operations on them, saving a node if one needs to concatenate two as well.

## Inputs

### A ( [char](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Char "Type:Char"))

The first character to combine.

### B ( [char](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Char "Type:Char"))

The second character to combine.

## Outputs

### \\* ( [string](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:String "Type:String"))

`A` and `B` combined into a string.

## Examples

- [![Two Random Int nodes are connected to From UTF16 nodes. Each random int is between 64 and 90. Both characters are plugged in to the concatenate string node, which outputs a two-character long random string of ASCII values](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/8/82/Protoflux_example_Concatenate_Chars.webp/480px-Protoflux_example_Concatenate_Chars.webp.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:Protoflux_example_Concatenate_Chars.webp "Example of using Concatenate Chars in some ProtoFlux code, wherein two random characters are combined to make a string.")
