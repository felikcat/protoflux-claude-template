Geometry 3D

The **Sphere For Tangent Line** node takes a line point for our sphere point, a line in 3D space, and point for the line, creating a sphere in 3D space. Then it returns the point and radius of a sphere, similar to a reversed [Tan](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Tan "ProtoFlux:Tan") node.

## Inputs

### LinePoint ( [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3"))

The point where the line is.

### LineDirection ( [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3"))

The direction of a line provided.

### SphereCenter ( [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3"))

The sphere point we want to make (in some distance away from the line).

## Outputs

### TangentPoint ( [float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3"))

Returns the tangent point where the line and sphere touch.

### Radius ( [float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float"))

Returns the radius of the sphere that is created by this calculation.
