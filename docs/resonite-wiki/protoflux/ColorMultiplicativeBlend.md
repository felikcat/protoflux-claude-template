Multiplicative Blend

Source

\*

Destination

Colors

Color Multiplicative Blend does a multiplicative blend of its two input colors. The result is the product of each component between the target and destination.

This is a symmetric operation, the result is the same with target and destination swapped. Regardless, the "target" and "destination" terminology is used for consistency with other blend nodes.

## Inputs

### Source ( [Color](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Color "Type:Color"))

The color that is blended "onto" the destination.

### Destination ( [Color](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Color "Type:Color"))

The destination color that the source is blended "onto".

## Outputs

### \\* ( [Color](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Color "Type:Color"))

The blended color result.
