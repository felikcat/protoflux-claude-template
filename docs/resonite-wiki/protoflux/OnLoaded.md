On Loaded

Trigger

Events

On Loaded is a Protoflux node that triggers for its allocating user whenever the node is loaded for the first time (not when it's duplicated). This happens on world loads and object loads.

TODO: Does this node fire when the entire node group this is connected to is loaded? or all of them? or just this one node?

## Outputs

### Trigger ( [Call](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses"))

Sends an Impulse when the node is loaded. This Impulse is owned by the allocating user.

## Examples
