POST String sends a HTTP request with POST method on call and decode its content with given charset in the `Content-Type` header (See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Type) to obtain more info about the header). Defaults to UTF-8 if charset is not present in the header, or the header itself does not exist.

Authorization - i.e. via BasicAuth - is currently _not_ supported.

This is not suitable for binary-transmission, as this node decodes the whole response as a human-readable string. Consider using one of the [Asset Providers](https://wiki.resonite.com/Category:Components:Assets "Category:Components:Assets") if your intention is fetching remote assets such as [Texture2D](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:StaticTexture2D "Component:StaticTexture2D").


![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/d/dd/InformationIcon.svg)

This node is best used with an impulse from the client actually wanting to fulfill the data transfer task. See [Security/Consent and surrounding info.](https://wiki.resonite.com/Connecting_Resonite_to_Other_Applications#Security_/_Consent "Connecting Resonite to Other Applications")

## Inputs

### \\* ( [AsyncCall](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses"))

Trigger to send a get request to the URL ( [Uri](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Uri "Type:Uri")) server location

### URL ( [Uri](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Uri "Type:Uri"))

The server location to send the get request to.

### String ( [string](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:String "Type:String"))

The string literal for the content we want to POST into for the receiving end.

### MediaType ( [string](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:String "Type:String"))

The media type (also known as Content Type) that we are aiming for. This defaults to "application/json".

For more information about the different types of media, see [Media Type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_type).

## Outputs

### OnSent ( [AsyncCall](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses"))

Fires immediately after the request is sent, so multiple async functions can happen in parallel.

### OnResponse ( [Continuation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses"))

Fires after the server has responded with either (TODO: Which responses are valid?) HTTP code and sent a string based response. The node will output these to their respective outputs during this pulse.

### OnError ( [Continuation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses"))

Fires after the HTTP client concludes that the request failed due to an underlying issue such as network connectivity, DNS failure, server certificate validation or timeout.

### OnDenied ( [Continuation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses"))

Fires after the user processing the request denied access request prompt to the Uri host, or denied by their setting. Please see [external connection page](https://wiki.resonite.com/Connecting_Resonite_to_Other_Applications#Security_/_Consent "Connecting Resonite to Other Applications") for more information.

### StatusCode ( [HTTP Status Code](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:HttpStatusCode "Type:HttpStatusCode"))

The code that the server responded with, no matter if it failed, was denied, succeeded at a response, or returned an error. This only exists during the OnResponse ( [Continuation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses")), OnError ( [Continuation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses")), and OnDenied ( [Continuation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses")) impulses. Default to 0 if request has not been sent, or terminaed by an error described in OnError section.

### Content ( [String](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:String "Type:String"))

The response that the server gave, or message of the thrown exception during HTTP request. This only exists during the OnResponse ( [Continuation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Impulses "Impulses")) impulse.
