This article describes a feature marked as legacy—this usually means there's a newer, better alternative. Legacy features might not be removed but they will not be updated, and the [team](https://wiki.resonite.com/Resonite_Team "Resonite Team") will not provide any support for them.

[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/a/a1/LegacyCanvasPanelComponent.png/510px-LegacyCanvasPanelComponent.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:LegacyCanvasPanelComponent.png) **Legacy Canvas Panel** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

The **LegacyCanvasPanel** component was used to control content that used backing panels. It is a leftover component from older content. It should not be used, and should be replaced whenever possible.
