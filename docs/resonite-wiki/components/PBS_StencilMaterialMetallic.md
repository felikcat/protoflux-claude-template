[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/f/ff/PBS_StencilMaterialMetallicComponent.png/510px-PBS_StencilMaterialMetallicComponent.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:PBS_StencilMaterialMetallicComponent.png) **PBS Stencil Material Metallic** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

The **PBS\_StencilMaterialMetallic** component is used as a material for meshes to make them render differently when in front of other stencil materials.

See [Stencils](https://wiki.resonite.com/Stencil "Stencil").

## Fields

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `persistent` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Determines whether or not this item will be saved to the server. |
| `UpdateOrder` | **[Int](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Int "Type:Int")** | Controls the order in which this component is updated. |
| `Enabled` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Controls whether or not this component is enabled. Some components stop their functionality when this field is disabled, but some don't. |
| `HighPriorityIntegration` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | If true, integrating this asset (e.g. processing procedural assets) gets higher priority than assets with this flag off. An example is user laser procedural meshes. |
| `TextureScale` | **[Float2](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float2 "Type:Float2")** | How much to scale up or down the different texture maps. |
| `TextureOffset` | **[Float2](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float2 "Type:Float2")** | How much to shift around the position of the different texture maps. |
| `AlbedoColor` | **[ColorX](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorX "Type:ColorX")** | The color to multiply the texture of the albedo (base color) with. Basically a tint. Default white. |
| `AlbedoTexture` | **[ITexture2D](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ITexture2D "Type:ITexture2D")** | The texture to use as the color of the surface. |
| `EmissiveColor` | **[ColorX](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorX "Type:ColorX")** | The color to multiply the texture of the emission (glowly color) with. Basically a tint. Default white. |
| `EmissiveMap` | **[ITexture2D](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ITexture2D "Type:ITexture2D")** | The texture to use as the glowing (emission) color of the surface. |
| `NormalMap` | **[ITexture2D](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ITexture2D "Type:ITexture2D")** | The normal map is used as a way to change the appearance of a surface when shined on by lights, to give the illusion of a raised surface. |
| `NormalScale` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | How much to scale up the effect of the normal map. |
| `OcclusionMap` | **[ITexture2D](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ITexture2D "Type:ITexture2D")** | Used to specify surface parts in eternal shadow due to being close to other mesh parts. |
| `ColorMask` | **[ColorMask](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorMask "Type:ColorMask")** | What colors behind the material should make it through the filter. |
| `StencilComparison` | **[StencilComparison](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:StencilComparison "Type:StencilComparison")** | See [Type:StencilComparison](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:StencilComparison "Type:StencilComparison") for an in depth explanation on what this does. |
| `StencilOperation` | **[StencilOperation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:StencilOperation "Type:StencilOperation")** | See [Type:StencilOperation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:StencilOperation "Type:StencilOperation") for an in depth explanation on what this does. |
| `StencilID` | **[Byte](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Byte "Type:Byte")** | The Stencil ID of this material. This is sometimes written to the frame buffer's [Stencil](https://wiki.resonite.com/Stencil "Stencil") mask, or used to determine whether this material should render for a particular pixel. |
| `StencilWriteMask` | **[Byte](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Byte "Type:Byte")** | does a Bitwise AND with this number for every pixel in the frame buffer this is rendering on top of when this object is drawn, after reading from the buffer. |
| `StencilReadMask` | **[Byte](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Byte "Type:Byte")** | is bitwise ANDed with the [Stencil](https://wiki.resonite.com/Stencil "Stencil") in the frame buffer before the test compares them. |
| `OffsetFactor` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | How much this material should be pushed forwards or backwards on the depth buffer, based on the polygon's slope relative to the camera (i.e. polygons parallel to the camera will not be affected by this).[\[1\]](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:PBS_StencilMaterialMetallic#cite_note-Material_OffsetFactor/Units_Desc-1) |
| `OffsetUnits` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | How much this material should be pushed forwards or backwards on the depth buffer (regardless of the polygon's slope relative to the camera), in units equal to the smallest possible difference for the rendering device being used.[\[1\]](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:PBS_StencilMaterialMetallic#cite_note-Material_OffsetFactor/Units_Desc-1) |
| `RenderQueue` | **[Int](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Int "Type:Int")** | changes at which point a material renders on the render stack |
| `__rectDummy` | **[Rect](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Rect "Type:Rect")** | currently does nothing |
| `__rectClipDummy` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | currently does nothing |
| `Metallic` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | The metallicness of the material in the absence of the metallic+reflectiveness image map. |
| `Smoothness` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | The Smoothness value in the absence of the Metallic+Smoothness image map. |
| `MetallicMap` | **[ITexture2D](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ITexture2D "Type:ITexture2D")** | [Metallic Maps](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:PBS_Metallic#Metallic_Maps "Component:PBS Metallic") |
| `_regular` | **[Shader](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Shader "Type:Shader")** | Internal. |
