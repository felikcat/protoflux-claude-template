[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/b/be/StaticShaderComponent.png/510px-StaticShaderComponent.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:StaticShaderComponent.png) **Static Shader** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

The **StaticShader** component is used to handle the shaders often seen in [Materials](https://wiki.resonite.com/Materials "Materials").

Shaders of these types are currently compiled by unity into the form of HLSL shader code, and are not ever interacted with by the player, and unapproved shaders are blocked by the [FrooxEngine](https://wiki.resonite.com/FrooxEngine "FrooxEngine")

> The tooling has become very "fixed". A lot of this comes down to Unity's migration from runtime compiled shaders to statically compiled shaders entirely within the editor. If you want yet another reason why we don't support custom shaders today, this is another part of it.

## Usage

Don't use this directly, but it is used by materials to insert textures and colors via the material keywords (So Albedo gets plugged into \_Albedo on the shader parameters)
