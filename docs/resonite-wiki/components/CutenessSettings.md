[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/8/85/CutenessSettingsComponent.png/510px-CutenessSettingsComponent.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:CutenessSettingsComponent.png) **Cuteness Settings** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

This component is solely a joke, and is supposed to make a setting that marks [U-GlitchFur](https://wiki.resonite.com/index.php?title=User:GlitchFur&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:GlitchFur (page does not exist)") as cute and cannot be changed. It only appears for that user.
