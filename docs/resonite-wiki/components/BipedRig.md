[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/d/d3/BipedRig.png/510px-BipedRig.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:BipedRig.png) **Biped Rig** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

This component is used by [ProtoFlux](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux "ProtoFlux") and other Resonite systems to read the different parts of an anthro/humanoid avatar by [Body Node](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:BodyNode "Type:BodyNode"). This is created and assigned to by the Assimp import system that [FrooxEngine](https://wiki.resonite.com/FrooxEngine "FrooxEngine") uses internally, and cannot be edited in game without mods. If this component is deleted, internal code or ProtoFlux might not be able to read what parts of your body are which Body Node designation, and will cause issues in user creations and some FrooxEngine functions. If the Biped Rig is not present or it does not contain the slot for the Body Node, the Body Node search will fallback to looking for AvatarObjectSlot components on the user instead.
