[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/2/21/RefEditorComponent.png/510px-RefEditorComponent.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:RefEditorComponent.png) **Ref Editor** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

The **RefEditor** component is used internally by [inspectors](https://wiki.resonite.com/Inspector "Inspector") to show the human readable name of any [IWorldElement](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:IWorldElement "Type:IWorldElement"). Whenever you are looking at a field and see a text like "Enabled on ObjectRoot on ComponentHolder", that description is generated by this component. This can be used to identify fields in the process of [Ref Hacking](https://wiki.resonite.com/Ref_Hacking "Ref Hacking") which is one of the [Things to Avoid](https://wiki.resonite.com/Things_to_Avoid "Things to Avoid")
