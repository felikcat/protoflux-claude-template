Box Array Mesh is a component that is generated by brush tools and can be a cloud of boxes with points, sizes, and rotations.

Note: `Points`, `Sizes`, `Rotations`, `Colors`, and `UV_Scales` arrays must be the same length for this component to work.

## Fields

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `persistent` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Determines whether or not this item will be saved to the server. |
| `UpdateOrder` | **[Int](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Int "Type:Int")** | Controls the order in which this component is updated. |
| `Enabled` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Controls whether or not this component is enabled. Some components stop their functionality when this field is disabled, but some don't. |
| `HighPriorityIntegration` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | If true, integrating this asset (e.g. processing procedural assets) gets higher priority than assets with this flag off. An example is user laser procedural meshes. |
| `OverrideBoundingBox` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Force the bounding box calculated from this component to use `OverridenBoundingBox` instead of calculating when requested. |
| `OverridenBoundingBox` | **[BoundingBox](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:BoundingBox "Type:BoundingBox")** | the bounding box this component should say it has when `OverrideBoundingBox` is enabled. Useful for bounding box calculations with Flux, or changing the selection box for this component when rendered. |
| `Profile` | **[ColorProfile](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorProfile "Type:ColorProfile")** | The profile that the vertex colors for this mesh should be displayed in. |
| `Points` | _[array](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncArray%601 "Type:SyncArray`1")_ of **[Float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3")** | List of positions that there should be boxes |
| `Sizes` | _[array](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncArray%601 "Type:SyncArray`1")_ of **[Float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3")** | List of sizes for each box. |
| `Rotations` | _[array](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncArray%601 "Type:SyncArray`1")_ of **[FloatQ](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:FloatQ "Type:FloatQ")** | List of rotations for each box. |
| `Colors` | _[array](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncArray%601 "Type:SyncArray`1")_ of **[Color](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Color "Type:Color")** | List of colors for each box. |
| `ColorsProfile` | **[ColorProfile](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorProfile "Type:ColorProfile")** | The profile that the vertex colors for this mesh should be displayed in.. However, this is for every box in the array. |
| `UV_Scales` | _[array](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncArray%601 "Type:SyncArray`1")_ of **[Float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3")** | List of UV scales for each box, scaling the material surface detail bigger or smaller. |

## Sync Delegates

| Method Name | Method type and Arguments. | Is the method hidden? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BakeMesh:Action` | **[Action](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Action "Type:Action")** | X | Bake meshes is a sync method that creates a static mesh component with this component, replaces all references to this component with the static mesh component, then deletes this component. |

## Usage

Use a brush tool from `ResoniteEssentials/Tools/Brushes/Box Brushes` and draw to make one of these with values already initialized.

## Examples

An example of the result of a box array mesh generated by a brush tool.
