[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/7/7b/TweenComponent.png/510px-TweenComponent.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:TweenComponent.png) **Tween<t>** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

The **Tween** component is usually auto generated by [ProtoFlux](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux "ProtoFlux") or by holding an object and hitting primary to align the object. The purpose of this component is to handle transitions in a value to value manner and only exists temporarily. This is not used for animations, only for a transition from one value to another. For animations, see either [Component:ValueGradientDriver](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:ValueGradientDriver "Component:ValueGradientDriver") or [Component:Animator](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:Animator "Component:Animator")
