[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/f/f7/TriangleDiagnosticMeshComponent.png/510px-TriangleDiagnosticMeshComponent.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:TriangleDiagnosticMeshComponent.png) **Triangle Diagnostic Mesh** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

The **TriangleDiagnosticMeshes** component is used to show where a triangle is in the world. This is usually used as a debug tool.

## Fields

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `persistent` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Determines whether or not this item will be saved to the server. |
| `UpdateOrder` | **[Int](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Int "Type:Int")** | Controls the order in which this component is updated. |
| `Enabled` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Controls whether or not this component is enabled. Some components stop their functionality when this field is disabled, but some don't. |
| `HighPriorityIntegration` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | If true, integrating this asset (e.g. processing procedural assets) gets higher priority than assets with this flag off. An example is user laser procedural meshes. |
| `OverrideBoundingBox` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Force the bounding box calculated from this component to use `OverridenBoundingBox` instead of calculating when requested. |
| `OverridenBoundingBox` | **[BoundingBox](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:BoundingBox "Type:BoundingBox")** | the bounding box this component should say it has when `OverrideBoundingBox` is enabled. Useful for bounding box calculations with Flux, or changing the selection box for this component when rendered. |
| `Profile` | **[ColorProfile](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorProfile "Type:ColorProfile")** | The profile that the vertex colors for this mesh should be displayed in. |
| `TriangleIndex` | **[Int](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Int "Type:Int")** | The index of the triangle on the mesh to make a diagnostic for. |
| `Vertex0Color` | **[Color](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Color "Type:Color")** | The vertex color of vertex 0 for this diagnostic mesh. |
| `Vertex1Color` | **[Color](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Color "Type:Color")** | The vertex color of vertex 1 for this diagnostic mesh. |
| `Vertex2Color` | **[Color](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Color "Type:Color")** | The vertex color of vertex 2 for this diagnostic mesh. |
| `VertexColorProfile` | **[ColorProfile](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorProfile "Type:ColorProfile")** | The color profile of the input [Colors](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Color "Type:Color") of `Vertex0Color`, `Vertex1Color`, and `Vertex2Color`. |
| `Displace` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | How much to displace the triangle's position by it's normal (front face direction) |
| `Mesh` | **[Mesh](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Mesh "Type:Mesh")** | The mesh to make a diagnostic for. |

## Usage

## Examples

This component is usually generated by [ProtoFlux Raycast One Nodes](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux:Raycast_One "ProtoFlux:Raycast One") whenever their debug mode is enabled.
