[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/0/09/HapticPointSamplerComponent.png/510px-HapticPointSamplerComponent.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:HapticPointSamplerComponent.png) **Haptic Point Sampler** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

The **HapticPointSampler** component acts as the receiver of haptics events and the in game world point for a haptics device recognized by the Resonite [Haptics](https://wiki.resonite.com/Haptics "Haptics") system.

This works as part of the game's robust [Haptics](https://wiki.resonite.com/Haptics "Haptics") system.
