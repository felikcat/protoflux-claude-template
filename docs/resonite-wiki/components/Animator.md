[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/9/95/AnimatorComponent.png/510px-AnimatorComponent.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:AnimatorComponent.png) **Animator** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

Animator is a component that's used to play [Animation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Animation "Type:Animation") and drive a list of fields using the contained animation data. The order and type of said fields is determined by the [Animation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Animation "Type:Animation") in the `Clip` field, and the value sampled from the [Animation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Animation "Type:Animation") for any field (`Fields`) is determined by the [Animation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Animation "Type:Animation")'s sampled value at the position the `_playback` is currently at. Sampling is determined by the type of [Animation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Animation "Type:Animation")`Clip` is. You should be able to [drive](https://wiki.resonite.com/Drive "Drive") field by assigning [ValueField](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:ValueField "Component:ValueField")'s `Value` onto `Fields`.

## Usage

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `persistent` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Determines whether or not this item will be saved to the server. |
| `UpdateOrder` | **[Int](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Int "Type:Int")** | Controls the order in which this component is updated. |
| `Enabled` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Controls whether or not this component is enabled. Some components stop their functionality when this field is disabled, but some don't. |
| `_playback` | _direct_ **[SyncPlayback](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncPlayback "Type:SyncPlayback")** | Is populated by the length and properties of `Clip` and is used to determine what point at which to sample the `Clip`. |
| `Clip` | **[Animation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Animation "Type:Animation")** | An [Animation](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Animation "Type:Animation") used to determine the list of `Fields` on this component and their value/ref types. |
| `Fields` | _[list](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncList%601 "Type:SyncList`1")_ of **[DriveRef\`1](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:DriveRef%601 "Type:DriveRef`1") < [IField](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:IField "Type:IField") >** | the list of values stored in this animation. Each field and it's type/animation data is determined by track index order. |

### Special Functions

| Method Name | Method type and Arguments. | Is the method hidden? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `OnSetupFieldsByName:ButtonEventHandler` | **[ButtonEventHandler](https://wiki.resonite.com/index.php?title=Type:ButtonEventHandler&action=edit&redlink=1 "Type:ButtonEventHandler (page does not exist)")** | ✓ | Sets up all the target values based on the `property` field of each track in the animation `Clip` file. |

## Behavior

This component doesn't require every item of `Fields` to be filled out to still function. This behavior can be taken advantage of.

In the case of Ghostly's Mantis Blade, the arm which the blade is attached to comes with an animation to animate the blade. However, the animation being imported onto a full [VRIK](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:VRIK "Component:VRIK") rig will prevent the VRIK from being generated. Though if the model is imported again without the animation, the rig will not be animated but it will have VRIK. If the Animator component is moved to the root of the VRIK avatar and the user hits set up slots, then the animator will animate the mantis blade on the arm once again, even though most of the fields are empty.

To drive a VRIK like a person however, you cannot currently drive one directly or switch out the drivers with a VRIK at runtime. The game will actively fight what you are doing. **Instead** you should use an Anchor and pin the user via anchor constraints to make them pose into the position you want. Some user dance creations use this. For fingers, use the [Finger Posing System](https://wiki.resonite.com/Finger_Posing_System "Finger Posing System").

## Examples

This is generated by the GLTF and FBX importers when a file with animation data is imported. Any extra animations that don't fit into the animator (EX: NLA tracks from Blender3D) when the animation is imported is put as a component attached to the AssetSlot for the file that is generated by the importer while importing.
