## Usage

## Examples

Notes:

\- Any extra Static Animation Providers that don't fit into an [Animator](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:Animator "Component:Animator") for a file (EX: NLA tracks from Blender3D) when the animation is imported, is put as a component attached to the AssetSlot for the file. The assets slot for a file is generated by the importer while importing. Keeping in mind that a [Animator](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:Animator "Component:Animator") can only support 1 animation, this means all but one animation in a file will end up on the assets slot. Why the importer doesn't put it into a multiplexer instead is unknown and can be confusing to the user. If the item is saved without referencing the other animations generated by the importer in the item, then the animation data will be lost and will have to be reimported. Putting animations that are imported into a multiplexer manually is usually a good idea for items like doors and NPC characters.

\- Keeping this component on a slot rather than in the assets can prove beneficial to the user. For example, [989onan](https://wiki.resonite.com/User:989onan "User:989onan")'s MMD player and Emote System keep this component on the disks and menu items for dances, so they can be kept and then filled into an animator automatically, allowing for multiple animation type systems.
