Null texture providers are automatically added to the [Root](https://wiki.resonite.com/Root "Root") as a way of telling the render engine of [FrooxEngine](https://wiki.resonite.com/FrooxEngine "FrooxEngine") what to use as a null texture when a material is missing. This texture is a procedural gray and dark gray checkerboard texture.
