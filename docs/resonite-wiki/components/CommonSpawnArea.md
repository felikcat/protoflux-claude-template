[![A photo of the common spawn area component and it's fields in the inspector.](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/9/92/CommonSpawnAreaComponent.webp/300px-CommonSpawnAreaComponent.webp.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:CommonSpawnAreaComponent.webp) The CommonSpawnArea component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

The **CommonSpawnArea** component is a [user](https://wiki.resonite.com/User "User") spawner that can take a range from a [Point Generator Type](https://wiki.resonite.com/Category:Components:Transform:Point_Generators "Category:Components:Transform:Point Generators").

If there is no **CommonSpawnArea** in the [World](https://wiki.resonite.com/World "World"), the user will spawn at the coordinates `0, 0, 0`.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `persistent` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Determines whether or not this item will be saved to the server. |
| `UpdateOrder` | **[Int](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Int "Type:Int")** | Controls the order in which this component is updated. |
| `Enabled` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Controls whether or not this component is enabled. Some components stop their functionality when this field is disabled, but some don't. |
| `SpawnPointGenerator` | **[IPointGenerator](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:IPointGenerator "Type:IPointGenerator")** | A [Point Generator Type](https://wiki.resonite.com/Category:Components:Transform:Point_Generators "Category:Components:Transform:Point Generators") component. This determines which points the spawn area will use for spawning new users. |
| `FloorPointRay` | **[Float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3")** | Shoots a ray from the slot containing this component and trys to detect a floor |
| `OtherUserCheckRadius` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | A minimum of how far away other users must be before a spawn point generated by SpawnPointGenerator is valid. |
| `ParentUser` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | If true, newly-spawned users will be parented to the slot holding this component. |
| `OrientUser` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | If true, newly-spawned users will be oriented towards the Z- axis that the slot holding this component is facing. |
| `ScaleUser` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | If true, newly-spawned users will be scaled to be the same scale as the slot holding this component. This can cause issues with parenting, so take care. |
| `Capacity` | **[Int](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Int "Type:Int")** | The maximum number of users that can be spawned in the slot holding this component at any given time. A value of -1 makes the maximum unlimited. |
| `BaseWeight` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | The chance this spawner will be used to spawn users. The higher the number, the more likely the chance. |
| `PositionNode` | **[UserRoot.UserNode](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:UserRoot#UserNode "Component:UserRoot")** | Positions the user based on this body node. |
| `RotationNode` | **[UserRoot.UserNode](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:UserRoot#UserNode "Component:UserRoot")** | Rotates the user based on this body node. |
| `ParentOverride` | **[Slot](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Slot "Type:Slot")** | Where to place users instead of under this component's Slot. |

## Usage

Unlike other user spawner components, the **CommonSpawnArea** component allows you to use a [Point Generator Type](https://wiki.resonite.com/Category:Components:Transform:Point_Generators "Category:Components:Transform:Point Generators") component to define an arbitrary area in which users can spawn from. This gives you more granular control over a spawn area than [SpawnArc](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:SpawnArc "Component:SpawnArc").

When multiple **CommonSpawnArea** components are present within a world, [Resonite](https://wiki.resonite.com/Resonite "Resonite") will pick one at random, based on the `BaseWeight` property.
