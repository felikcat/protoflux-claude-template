[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/0/05/PBS_VoronoiCrystalComponent.png/510px-PBS_VoronoiCrystalComponent.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:PBS_VoronoiCrystalComponent.png) **PBS Voronoi Crystal** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

The **PBS\_VoronoiCrystal** component is generated by making a random grid of points, then doing a gradient based on the distance from a point to the midway point to another point on the random point grid. this makes a set of "cells" which can be used to create stars or other effects for use on surfaces.

## Fields

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `persistent` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Determines whether or not this item will be saved to the server. |
| `UpdateOrder` | **[Int](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Int "Type:Int")** | Controls the order in which this component is updated. |
| `Enabled` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Controls whether or not this component is enabled. Some components stop their functionality when this field is disabled, but some don't. |
| `HighPriorityIntegration` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | If true, integrating this asset (e.g. processing procedural assets) gets higher priority than assets with this flag off. An example is user laser procedural meshes. |
| `_shader` | **[Shader](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Shader "Type:Shader")** | Internal. |
| `NoiseScale` | **[Float2](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float2 "Type:Float2")** | how scaled up or down the noise pattern is. |
| `NoiseAnimationOffset` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | How offset the noise animation is. Allows for animating the material over time using a time driver [Component](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component "Component")/ [ProtoFlux](https://wiki.resonite.com/ProtoFlux "ProtoFlux"). |
| `CellColorTint` | **[ColorX](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorX "Type:ColorX")** | The tint color to multiply different cells generated by as part of the voronoi texture. |
| `ColorGradient` | **[ITexture2D](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ITexture2D "Type:ITexture2D")** | The tint color of the cells generated towards their center as a sideways pixel line image. |
| `EmissionColor` | **[ColorX](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorX "Type:ColorX")** | The tint of the emission color. |
| `EmissionGradient` | **[ITexture2D](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ITexture2D "Type:ITexture2D")** | The emission/glow of the cells generated towards their center as a sideways pixel line image. |
| `SmoothnessGradient` | **[ITexture2D](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ITexture2D "Type:ITexture2D")** | The smoothness of the cells generated towards their center as a sideways pixel line image. |
| `CellSmoothness` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | The smoothness to multiply different cells generated by as part of the voronoi texture. |
| `CellMetallic` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | The metallicness to multiply the existing metallic gradient for different cells for the voronoi texture. |
| `NormalMap` | **[ITexture2D](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ITexture2D "Type:ITexture2D")** | The normal map is used as a way to change the appearance of a surface when shined on by lights, to give the illusion of a raised surface. |
| `NormalStrength` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | How much to scale up or down the effect of the normals. |
| `NormalTextureScale` | **[Float2](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float2 "Type:Float2")** | The scale of the `NormalMap` texture. |
| `NormalTextureOffset` | **[Float2](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float2 "Type:Float2")** | The offset of the `NormalMap` texture. |
| `EdgeThickness` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | The thickness of the edges between cells before they advance along the gradient texture towards the center. |
| `EdgeColor` | **[ColorX](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorX "Type:ColorX")** | The color of the material edge where it is being sliced. |
| `EdgeEmission` | **[ColorX](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorX "Type:ColorX")** | the emission color of the edges of the voronoi effect. |
| `EdgeSmoothness` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | the smoothness of the edges of the voronoi cells. |
| `EdgeMetallic` | **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | the metallicness of the edges of the voronoi cells. |
