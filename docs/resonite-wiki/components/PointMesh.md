[![](https://wiki.resonite.com/images/thumb/4/4e/PointMeshComponent.png/510px-PointMeshComponent.png)](https://wiki.resonite.com/File:PointMeshComponent.png) **Point Mesh** component as seen in the [Scene Inspector](https://wiki.resonite.com/Scene_Inspector "Scene Inspector")

Point mesh makes geometry data of a cloud of points that have UVs, scales, colors, and more. These points can be displayed via a [Mesh Renderer](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:MeshRenderer "Component:MeshRenderer") using a [Unlit Material](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:UnlitMaterial "Component:UnlitMaterial") with at least it's `UseBillboardGeometry` field set to true.

## Fields

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `persistent` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Determines whether or not this item will be saved to the server. |
| `UpdateOrder` | **[Int](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Int "Type:Int")** | Controls the order in which this component is updated. |
| `Enabled` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Controls whether or not this component is enabled. Some components stop their functionality when this field is disabled, but some don't. |
| `HighPriorityIntegration` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | If true, integrating this asset (e.g. processing procedural assets) gets higher priority than assets with this flag off. An example is user laser procedural meshes. |
| `OverrideBoundingBox` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Force the bounding box calculated from this component to use `OverridenBoundingBox` instead of calculating when requested. |
| `OverridenBoundingBox` | **[BoundingBox](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:BoundingBox "Type:BoundingBox")** | the bounding box this component should say it has when `OverrideBoundingBox` is enabled. Useful for bounding box calculations with Flux, or changing the selection box for this component when rendered. |
| `Profile` | **[ColorProfile](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorProfile "Type:ColorProfile")** | The profile that the vertex colors for this mesh should be displayed in. |
| `Points` | _[array](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncArray%601 "Type:SyncArray`1")_ of **[Float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3")** | The positions of each vertex point. |
| `Sizes` | _[array](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncArray%601 "Type:SyncArray`1")_ of **[Float2](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float2 "Type:Float2")** | The sizes of each vertex point. |
| `Rotations` | _[array](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncArray%601 "Type:SyncArray`1")_ of **[Float](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float "Type:Float")** | The rotations of each vertex point. |
| `Colors` | _[array](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncArray%601 "Type:SyncArray`1")_ of **[Color](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Color "Type:Color")** | The vertex color of each vertex point. |
| `ColorsProfile` | **[ColorProfile](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:ColorProfile "Type:ColorProfile")** | The color profile of each vertex point. |
| `UVs` | _[array](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:SyncArray%601 "Type:SyncArray`1")_ of **[Float4](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float4 "Type:Float4")** | The UV center and quad scales of each vertex point. |
| `Sort` | **[Bool](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Bool "Type:Bool")** | Enable sorting the mesh vertex indices by distance from `SortPoint`. |
| `SortPoint` | **[Float3](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Float3 "Type:Float3")** | The point to sort by distance from. |

## Sync Delegates

| Method Name | Method type and Arguments. | Is the method hidden? | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `BakeMesh:Action` | **[Action](https://wiki.resonite.com/Type:Action "Type:Action")** | X | Bake meshes is a sync method that creates a static mesh component with this component, replaces all references to this component with the static mesh component, then deletes this component. |

## Usage

Not usually usable by the user without [Mods](https://wiki.resonite.com/Mods "Mods"), as most fields depend on arrays.

## Examples

These are generated by the dot [Billboard Brushes](https://wiki.resonite.com/Component:BillboardBrushTool "Component:BillboardBrushTool") in Resonite Essentials/Brushes/Billboard Brushes.
